# FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Projects  

Hello, my name is **Shoaib Abdul Aleem**, and this repository contains my projects from the **FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design** course. I created this to showcase my progress and learning process as I build different projects.  

## About Me & This Project  

I am passionate about **frontend development** and love **software engineering**. My goal is to become a skilled frontend developer, and I hope this course helps me build more projects and improve my skills.  

This journey is just the beginning, and Iâ€™m excited to see how far I can go!
