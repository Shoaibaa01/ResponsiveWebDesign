## About the Project  

This is my first-ever project, and Iâ€™m excited to share it. After many tries and a lot of effort, I finally built my first website.  

This project is a **survey form** from FreeCodeCamp, but I added extra features to make it more interactive:  

- A **Start Here** page that leads to the survey  
- A **Thank You** page after submission  
- **Hover effects** and **basic animations**  
- **Responsive design** for all devices  

## Challenges  

While working on this, I faced a few challenges:  

- **Spacing elements** â€“ Getting everything positioned correctly was tricky.  
- **Responsive design** â€“ Making sure it worked on different screen sizes took time.  

I overcame these challenges through trial and error and by practicing a lot.  

## How I Built It  

- **I wrote almost all the code myself** â€“ Minimal AI assistance was used for coding.  
- **I used AI for content** â€“ The text was AI-generated since I wasnâ€™t sure what to write.  
- **I researched solutions** â€“ When I got stuck, I looked up examples but wrote my own code.  

The code might not be perfect, but I learned a lot while building this project.
