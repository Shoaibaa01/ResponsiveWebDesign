## About the Project  

This is my first-ever project, and Iâ€™m excited to share it. After many tries and a lot of effort, I finally built my first website.  

This project is a **survey form** from FreeCodeCamp, but I added extra features to make it more interactive:  

- A **Start Here** page that leads to the survey  
- A **Thank You** page after submission  
- **Hover effects** and **basic animations**  
- **Responsive design** for all devices  

## Challenges  

While working on this, I faced a few challenges:  

- **Spacing elements** â€“ Getting everything positioned correctly was tricky.  
- **Responsive design** â€“ Making sure it worked on different screen sizes took time.
