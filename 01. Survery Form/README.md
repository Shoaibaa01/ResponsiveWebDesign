## 📌 Project Overview  
This is my first project in the **Responsive Web Design** course by FreeCodeCamp. The project is a simple **survey form** designed to collect people's strategies for maintaining their mental health, such as meditation and exercise.  

> ⚠ **Note:** This is a **concept project**, and no data is connected to a backend.  

Since I have prior experience with **HTML and CSS**, I decided to take this project a step further, making it more **detailed and polished** than required.

## ✨ Features  
✔ **Fully Responsive** – The form adapts to different screen sizes for better accessibility.  
✔ **Multi-Page Flow** – Unlike the FreeCodeCamp version, my project includes:  
   - A **start survey page** before the form.  
   - A **thank you page** after form submission.  
✔ **Custom Styling & Enhancements** – Improved layout and aesthetics beyond the basic requirements.

## 🔧 Development & Challenges  
- I developed this project in **VS Code** instead of FreeCodeCamp’s text editor because I prefer its features, which boost my productivity.  
- **Spacing Issues** – Adjusting spacing was tricky, and I experimented a lot to get it right.  
- **Responsiveness Struggles** – Initially, making it responsive was difficult. I learned that styling for **mobile and desktop together** worked better than designing for desktop first and then making it responsive.  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack  
- **HTML & CSS** – Used for structuring and styling the project.  
- **Media Queries** – To ensure responsiveness across devices.  

---

## 🤖 AI Usage & Inspiration  
I did **not** use AI for coding, but I did refer to **ChatGPT** to find solutions for CSS-related issues.  
The **idea** for this project was suggested by ChatGPT, but the entire **development process was done by me**.

## 🚀 Final Thoughts  
This project is not perfect, but it's a **humble beginning** in my web development journey. Looking forward to improving my skills and building more projects in the future!
